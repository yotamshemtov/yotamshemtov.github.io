<!-- ### New Estimates of the Behavioral and Incapacitation Effects of Prison -->
<!-- #### with Evan K. Rose  (Job Market Paper) -->

<!-- U.S. courts provide constitutionally mandated legal services to indigent defendants via private court-appointed attorneys and public defenders' organizations. I investigate the relative efficacy of these two modes of indigent defense by comparing outcomes of co-defendants assigned either a public defender or a private court-appointed attorney within the same case. Using data from San Francisco and federal district courts, I argue and show empirically that in multiple defendant cases public defender assignment is as good as random. Estimates show that public defenders reduce the probability of any prison sentences by 22%, as well as the length of prison by 10%.   -->
